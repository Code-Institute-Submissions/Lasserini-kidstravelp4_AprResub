## 1. User Experience (UX)

### 1.1 Project introduction
This website is a concept model for a Website that attempts to help parents traveling with their children. It provides search functionality to find
experiences based on city and category filtering. This demo concept contains prepopulated experiences added for Florence & Copenhagen, whilst a fully
fletched version of the site would incorporate functionality to allow users to add additional experiences to the database.

Users can search for experiences, write their own review of the experiences and like experiences and reviews.

The Header and Footer are consistent and located on every page in the site.
*   The Welcome (Index) page includes:
    - **A larger profile picture on large screens** to give the user a strong visual illustration of the Psychotherapist (for small screens this feature is applied on the About Me page instead, this is done for visual design purposes).
    - **Box with key information** the very first thing a user comes across, displaying what services are on offer, where the clinic(s) are located and provides contact information. The box allows the user to quickly determine the relevance and hopefully provides assurance that the service might be worth considering. The box also offers a button to access more information about the Psychotherapist.
    - **Individual Therapy information** allows the user a brief overview and easy access the content page for one of the two main services.
    - **Couples Therapy information** allows the user a brief overview and easy access the content page for one of the two main services.
    - **Contact Information** to allow the user easy access to the site's primary function, which is leading towards a call-to-action of the user actively making contact to book therapy sessions. Throughout the site the contact information is repeated to remind users of making contact. The box also has a link to the contact page which adds a secondary option for contacting the Psychotherapist.
    - **Information about other services** allows the user brief introduction to the secondary services offered by the Psychotherapist, and provides a link to pricing information.
